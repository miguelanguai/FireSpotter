# PREDICTIVE FIRE PATH ALGORITHM

## Algorithm Structure


$Fire_prop = WindSpeed * 3600 * k_Terr * k_Fuel * k_Fc * k_Temp * k_Hum$

### kFuel

$k_Fuel:$ This is the name given to the value of the constant that gives us the propagation percentage.


This algorithm has been conceived based on parameters dependent on fire propagation, such as:

- **Campbell Fire Curve**: Predictive chart of fire evolution based on time.

For this reason, a data table was created to simulate this behavior. This table is determined by the following values, depending on the time.

By interpolating these values on a scale of [1-2], the following graph is derived:

### kFc (Fire Cone Constant)

$k_Fc$: The name assigned to the fire cone constant. This value, in turn, depends on an independent formula developed by the FireSpotter team and is determined by the wind's angle of incidence.

**Explanation**: When the wind impacts the wind rose, it has a direction and a sense since it is a vector quantity, which we have considered two-dimensional in our predictive model.

The values of the Campbell Fire Curve simulate the behavior of the fuel based on sun exposure. Therefore, the 45º point has been established, as it is directly related to the midpoint of 2 cardinal points as a multiplier of 0.5, and as the wind impacts, this factor will increase as it reaches 90º (Cardinal Point 1) or 0º (Cardinal Point 2). Thus, it is sought to include any type of angle between [0-90].

Next, an example is presented:

- Deg = 150º [NW Direction]

If Deg - deflection is between 45º and 90º:

$k_Fc' = (((Deg-deflection) - 45) * 0.01111 + 0.5)$

In the case that Deg-deflection is between 0º and 45º:

$k_Fc' = 1 - (((Deg-deflection) - 45) * 0.01111 + 0.5)$


Where 0.01111 is the conversion constant from 45º to 0.5 and from 90º and 0º to 1.

Once $k_Fc'$ is obtained, we proceed to calculate k_Fc:

$k_Fc = k_Fc' * k_Fuel$

### kTemp

k_Temp: Value of the constant dependent on temperature, with the formula:

$k_Temp = ((temp - temp_min) / (temp_max - temp_min))$

Where:

- $temp_min$: The minimum temperature of the day.
- $temp_max$: The maximum temperature of the day.

### kTerr

$k_Terr:$ Constant of terrain propagation. Due to a lack of information, it has been considered that k_Terr= 0 for water and $k_Terr$= 1 for mountains. Therefore, a value equal to 50% of conductivity has been obtained, with $k_Terr= 0.5$.

### kHum

k_Hum: Name given to the constant dependent on humidity, which responds to the following formula.

$k_Hum = ((100 - Hum) / 100)$


Where:

- Hum: Humidity measured as a percentage.

### WindSpeed

WindSpeed: Wind speed in m/s. This is why it is multiplied by 3600 to obtain the value in m/h.
